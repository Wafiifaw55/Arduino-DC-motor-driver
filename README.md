# Arduino+DC-motor-driver
File-1 & 2-in this project we program L298n DC motor driver with Arduino Uno board to control two DC motor and power up by 9volt battery, it includes schematic file and arduino code, this codes will make DC motor turne CW 1 second then CCW for 1 second, we atttach PWM pin from arduino board to L298n to control direction and speed of two motors.
file-3 & 4-in this project we also use arduino Uno board to controlling two parallel LED with PWM signals to saves energy, we can use it like an eyes for robot, we put the LED's in parallel to have same brightness and if one of thim is burned the other is work.
File-5-in this project we try to build power circuit for Arduino projects to power up it when we use it for our projects, there we make crcuit for charge the 9Volt battery to make system work any where, and easy to carry and recharge, this circuit build it after calculating the power requrment for Arduino boards to stay work for long time.
In the schematic file  i use Fritzing program for sumulation.
